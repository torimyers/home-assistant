# Test and Validate All Active Automations

## Problem/Goal
After fixing broken entity references and simplifying complex automations, need comprehensive testing to ensure all active automations work correctly and don't have validation errors.

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Test each active automation manually where possible
- [ ] Verify blueprint instances work correctly
- [ ] Check notification delivery for all notification automations
- [ ] Validate motion sensor automations trigger properly
- [ ] Test time-based and sun-based triggers
- [ ] Document any automations that still have issues
- [ ] Create test procedures for future validation

## Context Files
- @automations/ (all active automation files)
- @blueprints/automation/ (all blueprint files)

## User Notes
This is quality assurance after all the fixes. Focus on functional testing rather than just syntax validation. Make sure the automations actually do what they're supposed to do.
